# BUY DOMAIN

To buy a Stark domain through the Starknet Snap, you can use the `buy_domain` script from this repository. It will mint an identity, buy the domain and set it as main domain. To check available domains you can go on https://goerli.app.starknet.id.

Create a .env file following .env.example.

In `buy_domain`, update your `domain` name (line 58) and your `identity` number (line 59).
